User behaviour changes over time, this is framework does lifelong learning and able to capture complex hypothesis through online learning.


"Library Modification" folder : Contains files which need to be replaced for theano and keras library.

(1) Main model is inside "Continuous Authentication" folder.
(2) For running main model on a dataset of a user, place dataset '.mat' file in Continuous Authenicastion folder and change variable dataset = 'name_of_user'. 
(3) Model training hyperparameters are in hb19.yaml file.
